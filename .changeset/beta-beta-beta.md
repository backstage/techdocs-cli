'@techdocs/cli': minor

The `techdocs-cli publish` command will now publish TechDocs content to remote
storage using the lowercase'd entity triplet as the storage path. This is in
line with the beta release of the TechDocs plugin (`v0.11.0`).

If you have been running `techdocs-cli` prior to this version, you will need to
follow this [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-migrate-from-techdocs-alpha-to-beta).
